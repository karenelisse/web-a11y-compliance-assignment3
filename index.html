        Winston | Dog of the week
      </h3>

        />
        Winston is a very sweet but worried boy who has not experienced much outside his backyard in his former life. We soon figured out he cannot see much. The eye specialist said he has PRA (Progressive Retinal Atrophy), common in Poodles but not staffies. It is at an advanced stage so he only sees a bit in bright sunlight. He is such a sweet easy dog who lets you do anything to him. He would be best in a home with another playful dog who can be his eyes. He has a smooth coat and very overweight ATM and we are trying to trim him down. He is estimated to be close to 30kg. Winston is currently happy playing and running with a gentle playful female staffy in his foster home

        <img 
          alt="a black cat with white markings who is missing its right eye"
          src="resources/ariel.jpg"/>
        Ariel was rescued moments from being PTS at the pound and had an infected eye that could not be saved. He had severe flu, skin issues and dental disease but is now a happy healthy toothless boy feeling much better.
        <br/>Ariel has a dark brown and white coat with a solid 6kg build. A shy guy that does enjoy a brush and pat once he gets his swipes and hisses out of the way. He is over 8 years old, gets on well with other cats and enjoys lounging about.
        <br/>He comes desexed, wormed, F3 vaccinated, FIV/FeLV tested and microchipped. He is a healthy FIV positive cat. His adoption fee is $220.
        <br/>If you are interested in meeting him, fill in the Cat Adoption Questionnaire and email it to cats@DoggieRescue.com.

          Can you help our doggies run, play and heal in safety?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Our dream is to create a safe space where our doggies can run and play to help them rebuild their confidence and restore their spirits after their time at the council pounds. So many coming to us are withdrawn, depressed and highly stressed. We want to build our Freedom Dog Park right here at the shelter.
