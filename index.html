          Winston is a very sweet but worried boy who has not experienced much outside his backyard in his former life. He is such a sweet easy dog who lets you do anything to him. He would be best in a home with another playful dog who can be his eyes.

            Ariel has a dark brown and white coat with a solid 6kg build. A shy guy that does enjoy a brush and pat once he gets his swipes and hisses out of the way. He is over 8 years old, gets on well with other cats and enjoys lounging about. He comes desexed, wormed, F3 vaccinated and is a healthy FIV positive cat.

          <p>
            Our dream is to create a safe space where our doggies can run and play to help them rebuild their confidence and restore their spirits after their time at the council pounds. So many coming to us are withdrawn, depressed and highly stressed. We want to build our Freedom Dog Park right here at the shelter.
